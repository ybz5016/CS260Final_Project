# CS260Final_Project

This project is from [SemEval 2020 Task 4 - Commonsense Validation and Explanation (ComVE)](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) Subtask C.

## Our experiments:
1. Three pre-training approaches, GPT-2, NMT, and BART

* `data_dir`: experiment results with GPT-2:
    *  `subtaskC_answers_CONFIG.csv` are the files of the generated dev results
    *  `subtaskC_answers_test_CONFIG.csv` are the files of the generated test results

2. Commonsense Knowledge Graph
